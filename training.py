**Goal:**
Based on the provided EDA summary, feature engineering details, and the nature of the task (time-series regression for stock price prediction), select the most appropriate machine learning model(s) to train. Generate Python code to train the selected model(s), perform hyperparameter tuning using the validation set, save the best model, and report validation metrics.

**Contextual Information Provided:**
1.  **EDA Summary:** (Content of `eda_result_summary.txt`) - This includes insights on data distributions, correlations, outliers, and initial patterns.
2.  **Feature Engineering Details:** (Summary from the FE agent) - This includes:
    * List of final features (original + newly created market signals like SMAs, RSI, lags, volatility measures).
    * How missing values were imputed.
    * How categorical features (if any) were encoded.
    * How numerical features were scaled.
    * Paths to saved transformers (`numerical_imputer.pkl`, `scaler.pkl`, etc. - though the modeling script might not need to load these directly if X_train is already processed, they indicate what was done).
3.  **Data Paths:** `x_train.csv`, `y_train.csv`, `x_val.csv`, `y_val.csv`.
4.  **Task Type:** Time-series regression (predicting 'Close' price).
5.  **Key Objective:** Achieve the best possible RMSE (or other specified primary metric) on the validation set. Consider model interpretability as a secondary goal if possible.

**Instructions for Model Selection and Code Generation:**

1.  **Reason about Model Choice:**
    * Analyze the EDA summary and feature characteristics.
    * Given the creation of various technical indicators and potential non-linearities, suggest one or two primary model types that are well-suited for this kind of tabular, feature-rich time-series regression problem (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest Regressor).
    * Briefly justify your choice(s) based on the provided context.
    * Optionally, suggest a simpler baseline model (e.g., Ridge Regression) for comparison.

2.  **Generate Python Code (`model_training.py`) to:**
    * Load `x_train.csv`, `y_train.csv`, `x_val.csv`, `y_val.csv`.
    * Initialize the chosen model(s).
    * Define a suitable hyperparameter search space for each model.
    * Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV (from `sklearn.model_selection`) with an appropriate scoring metric (e.g., 'neg_root_mean_squared_error') and cross-validation strategy (for time-series, use `TimeSeriesSplit`) to tune the hyperparameters using `X_train` and `y_train`, validating against `X_val` and `y_val` (or use the CV object directly with `X_train`, `y_train` if not passing `X_val`, `y_val` to the search explicitly).
    * Identify and retrieve the best model and its parameters.
    * Train the best model on the full `X_train`, `y_train` data using these optimal hyperparameters.
    * Save the final trained model object (e.g., as `trained_model.pkl` using `joblib`).
    * Predict on `X_val` using the final model and calculate key regression metrics (RMSE, MAE, R-squared).
    * Print the best hyperparameters and validation metrics.

This way, GPT-4o isn't just picking a model randomly; it's using the accumulated knowledge from previous pipeline stages to make a more "intelligent" and context-aware decision.
